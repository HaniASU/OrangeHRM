# OrangeHRM
This repository aims to improve the security and usability of OrangeHRM. We've tested key features of the platform (demo site) to ensure it works smoothly.
What's Inside:
Test Cases: Covering login, user management, navigation, and admin roles, with both positive and negative scenarios.
Bug Reports: Highlighting key issues like weak passwords, SQL injection risks, and missing validation.
These tests aim to make OrangeHRM better for everyone. Feel free to contribute or report anything new!
